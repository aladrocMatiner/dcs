## Why

Add a DCS-focused Lua tutorial that teaches mission scripting fundamentals with a professional, practical tone and clear pedagogy, available in EN/ES/SV/FI.

## What Changes

- Introduce a new tutorial namespace under `docs/` for “DCS Lua Tutorial”.
- Add Chapter 01 in four languages.
- Establish a repeatable pattern so each future chapter can be delivered as its own OpenSpec change (one change per chapter).

## Impact

- Adds new documentation files only (no runtime code changes).
- Establishes documentation conventions (file naming, language bar, link localization).
