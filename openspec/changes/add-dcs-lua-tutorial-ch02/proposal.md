## Why

Chapter 02 should help new users go from “I understand what DCS Lua is” to “I can actually work with it”: set up an editor workflow, understand what (if anything) must be installed locally, and know the most common DCS Lua libraries and ecosystems used by the community.

## What Changes

- Add Chapter 02 in EN/ES/SV/FI focused on workflow/pipeline using Visual Studio Code.
- Explain DCS’s embedded Lua runtime vs optional local tooling (Lua interpreter, language server, formatting).
- Introduce common DCS Lua libraries/frameworks at a conceptual level (what they are for, when to use them).
- Update the tutorial index (`docs/dcs-Lua_Tutorial/README*`) to include Chapter 02 in all four languages.

## Impact

- Documentation-only change; no runtime code behavior changes.
- Establishes a repeatable workflow section reused by later chapters.
