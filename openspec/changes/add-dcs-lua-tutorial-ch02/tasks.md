## 1. Implementation

- [ ] 1.1 Add Chapter 02 files in four languages:
  - [ ] `docs/dcs-lua/ch02.md`
  - [ ] `docs/dcs-lua/ch02.es.md`
  - [ ] `docs/dcs-lua/ch02.sv.md`
  - [ ] `docs/dcs-lua/ch02.fi.md`
- [ ] 1.2 Update the tutorial index in all languages to include Chapter 02:
  - [ ] `docs/dcs-lua/README.md`
  - [ ] `docs/dcs-lua/README.es.md`
  - [ ] `docs/dcs-lua/README.sv.md`
  - [ ] `docs/dcs-lua/README.fi.md`
- [ ] 1.3 Chapter 02 content (workflow/pipeline, VS Code):
  - [ ] Explain the “pipeline” concept: author → package → run in DCS → observe → iterate
  - [ ] VS Code setup (conceptual + practical):
    - [ ] Recommended Lua extension / language server (editor diagnostics, completion)
    - [ ] Formatting strategy and conventions (what to format; keep diffs readable)
    - [ ] Suggested project folder layout for mission scripts
  - [ ] Clarify “installation”:
    - [ ] DCS includes its own Lua runtime for mission execution (no separate install needed to *run* in DCS)
    - [ ] Optional local installs to improve development (Lua interpreter, tooling) and what they are used for
  - [ ] Describe DCS scripting surface vs community libraries:
    - [ ] Distinguish built-in DCS scripting API (world/trigger/timer/etc.) from third-party libraries
    - [ ] List common libraries/frameworks (at least MOOSE and MIST) and what kinds of tasks they help with
    - [ ] Mention other commonly used add-ons (example categories: IADS, logistics, admin) with short “what it does”
  - [ ] Provide non-code “example ideas” of workflows enabled by libraries (conceptual, not code-heavy)
- [ ] 1.4 Keep the chapter didactic:
  - [ ] Use a “what it is / why it matters / when to use / common pitfalls” structure
  - [ ] Include a short “checklist” the reader can follow to confirm their pipeline is ready
- [ ] 1.5 Validate:
  - [ ] Run `openspec validate add-dcs-lua-tutorial-ch02 --strict`
  - [ ] Ensure internal Markdown links resolve (if any are added)
