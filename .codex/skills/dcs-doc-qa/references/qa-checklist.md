# DCS Docs QA Checklist

## Critical

- Relative links resolve (no broken paths).
- Language bars (if used) don’t link to themselves and point to existing files.
- Procedures have a clear step-by-step section.

## High value

- “Bindings checklist” exists and doesn’t invent defaults (use “(bind)” placeholders where needed).
- “Mouse vs bindings” note exists for cockpit controls.
- “Common mistakes” + recovery guidance exists.
- “Practice” section exists (what to do next).

## Consistency

- Headings are consistent across languages.
- Cockpit labels (`NAV`, `SPAK`, etc.) kept literal.
- Filenames and internal links use stable naming.
