## Goal

Make a mission that feels intentional: correct coalition setup, readable briefing, and stable training weather.

## Vocabulary (minimum)

- **Coalition**: which side a unit belongs to (Blue/Red/Neutral).
- **Briefing**: what the player reads (goal, start location, notes).
- **Weather preset**: simple, repeatable conditions for training.

## Step-by-step recipe: a clean training mission

1. Start from your `base_clean_v01.miz` (copy it → new name).
2. Set **time** (daylight) and **weather** (clear or light clouds).
3. Set **coalitions** (Blue/Red) for your scenario.
4. Write a simple briefing:
   - Title
   - 3 bullets: goal, rules, success condition

### Briefing template (copy/paste)

- **Goal**: Fly from A to B and return.
- **Rules**: No weapons, stay below 5,000 m.
- **Success**: Land back at base.

## Quick test

1. Save as `MyMission_ch02_v01.miz`.
2. Run the mission.
3. Confirm the briefing is visible and makes sense.

## Common errors and fixes

- **The mission feels confusing**:
  - Make the briefing shorter and more specific.
- **Wrong factions appear**:
  - Re-check coalitions for each country/unit.

## Mini‑lab (15–20 min)

Create two variants for later chapters:

- `training_clear_day_v01.miz`
- `training_overcast_day_v01.miz`

## Checklist

- Time/weather are deliberate (not random).
- Briefing tells the player exactly what to do.
