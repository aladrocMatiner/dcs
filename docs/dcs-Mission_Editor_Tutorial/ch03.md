## Goal

Create a mission you (and friends) can actually fly:

- A playable aircraft slot (`Client`).
- A safe start (hot or cold).
- A sensible payload.

## Vocabulary (minimum)

- **Client**: multiplayer slot (players can join).
- **Player**: single-player slot (only one).
- **Cold/Hot/Air start**: parking cold, parking hot, or already airborne.

## Recipe: one “ready to fly” client slot

1. Place an aircraft for your coalition at an airfield.
2. Set **Skill** to `Client`.
3. Choose start type:
   - Beginner-friendly: **Hot start** on parking or runway
   - Training: **Cold start** on parking (when you want startup practice)
4. Set a basic payload (fuel + basic stores if needed).
5. Name the group clearly (example: `BLUE_CLIENT_01`).

## Quick test

1. Save as `MyMission_ch03_v01.miz`.
2. Run the mission.
3. In role selection, confirm you can select your `Client` slot.
4. Spawn and verify:
   - You are at the correct airfield.
   - Aircraft systems behave as expected for your start type.

## Common errors and fixes

- **I can’t select the aircraft**:
  - It’s probably `Player` instead of `Client` (or wrong coalition).
- **I spawn in the air when I wanted parking**:
  - Check the “start type” option.
- **No rearm/refuel**:
  - Ensure you are at a valid airfield/FARP and that ground crew is available.

## Mini‑lab (20–30 min)

Make three slots:

- `BLUE_CLIENT_HOT`
- `BLUE_CLIENT_COLD`
- `BLUE_CLIENT_AIR`

This will help you test later chapters quickly.

## Checklist

- At least one `Client` slot works.
- Group naming is clear.
- Start type matches the training goal.
