## Goal

Get comfortable inside the Mission Editor so you don’t “fight the tool”.

By the end you will:

- Create a new mission and save it safely.
- Know what the main panels do.
- Have a repeatable workflow you’ll use in every chapter.

## The Mission Editor “mental model”

Think in layers:

1. **World setup** (map, weather, time, coalitions)
2. **Objects** (aircraft, vehicles, ships, statics)
3. **Logic** (zones, triggers, flags, menus)
4. **Test loop** (run mission → see result → adjust)

## The panels you must recognize

You don’t need to memorize every button. Just recognize these:

- **Left toolbar**: place objects (air, ground, ships, statics), draw zones.
- **Right panel**: properties of the selected unit/group (skill, route, tasks).
- **Top bar**: save/open, mission options, weather/time, briefing.
- **Trigger window**: conditions/actions (“when X, do Y”).

## Workflow you will use every time

1. Save immediately: `MyMission_ch01_v01.miz`
2. Make one change.
3. Save again (new version): `..._v02.miz`
4. Run and verify.

This makes it easy to rollback when something breaks.

## Quick test (step-by-step)

1. Open Mission Editor.
2. Create a new mission and **save it** with a versioned name.
3. Place a single static object (anything obvious).
4. Save again.
5. Run the mission.

### What you must see

- The mission loads without errors.
- Your static object is visible on the map/in the world.

## Common errors and fixes

- **I can’t find what I placed**:
  - Zoom out, then zoom in. Use the map view.
  - Place it near a known airfield.
- **I overwrote my mission**:
  - Start using versioned names (`v01`, `v02`, …).

## Mini‑lab (10–15 min)

Make a “clean base mission” you will copy forever:

- No units yet (or one test object).
- Briefing title filled.
- Saved as: `base_clean_v01.miz`

## Checklist

- I can create a mission, save it, and run it.
- I know where the unit properties are.
- I use versioned names.
