# Chapter 06 — Package `.miz` + upload + rotate on server (Windows + Linux)

## Goal

Take your mission from “works on my PC” to “runs on a server”:

- Prepare a clean `.miz` (versioned).
- Install/run a DCS server (Windows or Linux host).
- Add the mission to rotation and test safely.

## Important reality check (Linux)

The official DCS Dedicated Server is a Windows application. On Linux hosts you typically run it via Wine/Proton or in a Windows VM/container.
This chapter covers the **process and checklist**; the exact install steps depend on your setup.

## Part A — Prepare the mission for server use

### Naming + versioning (do this)

Use a clear naming scheme:

- `my_mission_name_v01.miz`
- `my_mission_name_v02.miz`

Keep a `CHANGELOG.md` (even a short bullet list) so you remember what changed.

### Server-friendly checklist

- Avoid “too many always-on AI units” on mission start (use late activation).
- Keep triggers gated (avoid infinite message spam).
- Make sure there is at least one `Client` slot per coalition you want to allow.

## Part B — Dedicated Server on Windows (high level)

### Install

Common options:

- Install “DCS Dedicated Server” (Steam) or a standalone dedicated server install.

What you need:

- The dedicated server program installed
- Your server instance created/configured (ports, name, password if any)

### Add missions

1. Copy your `.miz` file(s) into your server’s mission folder (or a known location).
2. In the server UI, add them to the mission list/rotation.
3. Set a simple rotation (1–3 missions first).

### Quick test

1. Start the server.
2. Join from your client PC.
3. Load the mission and confirm:
   - Slots appear
   - Mission starts
   - No trigger spam

## Part C — Server on Linux (high level)

Typical approaches:

- Run the Windows dedicated server using **Wine/Proton**.
- Run a small Windows VM and host the dedicated server inside it.

Key points:

- You still manage `.miz` missions the same way.
- Paths and “Saved Games” folders differ by setup.

### Quick test

Same as Windows: join, load mission, verify slots and stability.

## Part D — Safe rollout strategy

Do this when you update missions:

1. Upload new version alongside old (`v03` next to `v02`).
2. Test on a passworded server or off-hours.
3. If something breaks, roll back to the previous version immediately.

## Common errors and fixes

- **Players join but no slots**:
  - Ensure aircraft are `Client`, not `Player`.
  - Ensure correct coalition.
- **Server lags hard on mission start**:
  - Reduce always-active AI; use late activation and staged spawns.
- **Triggers behave differently on server**:
  - Remove “timing-sensitive” assumptions; add flags and delays.

## Mini‑lab (30–60 min)

Create a tiny “server smoke test” mission:

- 2 client slots
- 1 trigger message on mission start
- 1 F10 “Start exercise”
- 1 zone message

This is your canary mission for server health.
