# DCS Mission Editor Tutorial (Beginner-friendly)

🇬🇧 **English** | 🇪🇸 [Español](README.es.md) | 🇸🇪 [Svenska](README.sv.md) | 🇫🇮 [Suomi](README.fi.md)

This tutorial teaches you how to **create missions in the DCS Mission Editor** and then **upload/rotate them on a DCS server**.

- No Lua in this course (Lua is covered in `docs/dcs-Lua_Tutorial/`).
- Designed for low technical background + high simulator passion.
- Lots of “cookbook” steps and quick tests so you always know if it worked.

## How to use this tutorial (low frustration)

- Do chapters in order.
- After every chapter, run the “Quick test” in-game.
- Change **one thing at a time** and save often.
- Keep a “clean base mission” you can copy for new missions.

## Chapters

- [Chapter 01](ch01.md) — Mission Editor mindset + UI basics
- [Chapter 02](ch02.md) — Mission settings: weather/time/coalitions + briefing
- [Chapter 03](ch03.md) — Player slots (Client), starts, payload, airbases
- [Chapter 04](ch04.md) — Waypoints + basic AI groups (enough to build a scenario)
- [Chapter 05](ch05.md) — Triggers + flags + F10 radio menus (no Lua)
- [Chapter 06](ch06.md) — Package `.miz` + upload + rotate on server (Windows + Linux)
- [Cookbook](cookbook.md) — Copy/paste recipes (Mission Editor only)

## Missions folder (optional, recommended)

If you want, keep “lesson missions” here:

- `missions/README.md`
- `missions/course_base_chXX.miz`
- `missions/recipes/*.miz`

The repo can contain `.miz` later; the tutorial works even without them.
