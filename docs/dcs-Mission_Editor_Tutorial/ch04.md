## Goal

Build the “moving parts” of a mission:

- A simple flight route (waypoints).
- One basic AI group that does something predictable.

## Vocabulary (minimum)

- **Waypoint (WP)**: a point in a route (position + altitude + speed).
- **Group**: multiple units controlled together.
- **Late Activation**: the group exists but starts “off” until activated by triggers.

## Recipe A: a simple player route (A → B → RTB)

1. Select your player aircraft group.
2. Add waypoints:
   - `WP1`: after takeoff (climb)
   - `WP2`: training area / target area
   - `WP3`: return to base
3. Set reasonable speed/altitude for the aircraft.

## Recipe B: a simple ground convoy (predictable)

1. Place a ground group (your chosen side).
2. Give it a short route with 2–3 waypoints.
3. Set skill to a stable value (not random).
4. Name it clearly (example: `RED_CONVOY_01`).

Optional (recommended): enable **Late Activation** so you can control it later with triggers.

## Quick test

1. Save as `MyMission_ch04_v01.miz`.
2. Run the mission and:
   - Confirm your route exists on the map.
   - Confirm the convoy exists and moves (or is ready if late activated).

## Common errors and fixes

- **AI doesn’t move**:
  - Check if it’s late activated and never activated.
  - Check if the route is valid (not on water, not blocked).
- **Waypoints feel wrong**:
  - Make the route shorter and simpler first, then expand.

## Mini‑lab (20–30 min)

Create one “training area” with two groups:

- A convoy that starts only when you choose (late activated)
- A static object “target” near the convoy route

## Checklist

- You can create and follow a route.
- You can place an AI group and make it behave predictably.
