## Goal

Understand what DCS mission scripting is, why DCS uses Lua, and what kinds of problems scripting can solve — **without diving into code yet**.

## What DCS is (high level)

DCS is a combat flight simulator where most experiences are packaged as **missions**:

- A mission defines the world state: map, time, weather, units, waypoints, triggers, and rules.
- Missions can be “training”, “instant action”, “campaign”, “multiplayer scenarios”, etc.

The Mission Editor gives you a powerful no-code toolset (triggers, flags, conditions), and **Lua scripting** sits next to it when you need more flexibility.

## What “scripting” means

Scripting is about **describing behavior**: “when this happens, do that”.

It is not the same as:

- **Avionics coding** (how the aircraft systems are implemented)
- **Mods** (changing assets, cockpits, textures, flight models)

Mission scripting is primarily about the *scenario logic*.

## Why DCS uses Lua (conceptual)

DCS uses Lua for mission scripting because it is:

- **Embeddable**: game engines can run it inside their own systems.
- **Lightweight**: fast to load, simple syntax, easy to distribute with missions.
- **Flexible**: good fit for “event + rules + state” logic.

You don’t need to be a software engineer to benefit from it. Think of Lua as a way to upgrade your missions from “static” to “reactive”.

## What you can do with DCS Lua mission scripting (conceptual examples)

Below are examples of what Lua can help with. They are deliberately **conceptual** — your exact implementation can be Mission Editor triggers, Lua, or a mix of both.

### 1) Training and teaching

- Show step-by-step training cues (“Now set X”, “Good”, “Try again”).
- Create adaptive lessons: if the student is too fast/too slow/too high, give tailored feedback.
- Build repeatable practice patterns (e.g., “3 attempts”, timed evaluations, scoring).

### 2) React to events to drive the story

- When a unit takes off/lands: update objectives or unlock the next stage.
- When a target is destroyed: trigger a new task, spawn reinforcements, change radio messages.
- When a player enters a zone: start a timer, mark a checkpoint, or start an ambush.

### 3) Scenario flow and progression (state/flags)

Lua excels when you want missions to feel like a **state machine**:

- Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3, based on what actually happens.
- Score tracking, fail conditions, partial success, and branching outcomes.
- Persistent-feeling missions (even without true persistence) by simulating “progress” in one session.

### 4) AI and group control (high level)

- Activate groups only when needed (performance and pacing).
- Spawn or enable threats progressively.
- Push AI tasks dynamically (e.g., launch patrols, trigger intercepts, activate escorts).

### 5) Time, timers, and pacing

- Trigger events after delays (“if still alive after 5 minutes…”).
- Run periodic checks (“every 10 seconds, evaluate conditions”).
- Build tempo: escalation waves, recovery windows, and timed objectives.

### 6) Communication and immersion

- Dynamic briefing updates during the mission.
- Context-aware messages (“RTB”, “divert”, “threat detected”) based on what’s happening.
- Simple “radio-like” flow using timed messages and conditions.

### 7) Home cockpits and multi-monitor setups (Lua, but not mission scripting)

DCS also uses Lua outside “mission logic”. For physical cockpits and multi-monitor setups, Lua is commonly involved in:

- **Monitor configuration** (Lua monitor setup files) to place exported viewports on other screens.
- **Instrument/display exports** (depends on the aircraft): many modules can export MFDs and other repeaters; **some modules may provide HUD or other display viewports**, but this is not universal.
- **Export integration** (e.g., `Export.lua`) to send data to external apps/hardware (Helios, Arduino/USB panels, custom dashboards).

Practical example (conceptual): build a two-screen setup where your main monitor is the outside view, and a second monitor shows exported cockpit displays (e.g., MFDs/RWR) and training prompts — improving readability and making a home cockpit feel closer to a real trainer.

## Where Lua runs in DCS (overview)

In practice, mission Lua is typically executed via Mission Editor triggers such as:

- `DO SCRIPT` (paste/enter Lua text)
- `DO SCRIPT FILE` (run a Lua file you include with the mission)

You’ll learn the practical workflow in Chapter 02. For now, the key idea is:

- Mission scripting is part of the **mission logic layer**.
- You iterate by: change → run → observe → adjust.

## Debugging mindset (without tools yet)

Most mission scripting problems are not “hard programming bugs”; they are usually:

- A trigger didn’t fire.
- A name didn’t match (group/zone/unit name typos).
- A condition happened in a different order than you expected.

So your first habit should be: **prove that your logic executed** (then refine behavior).

## Common mistakes (and how to think about them)

- **Nothing happens**: assume your trigger didn’t fire, not that “Lua is broken”.
- **Wrong unit/group**: names must match exactly; treat naming as part of the system.
- **Trying to do too much at once**: reduce scope to one behavior, then expand.
- **Mixing responsibilities**: separate “detect event” from “do actions” mentally (and later in code).

## Next steps

Chapter 02 covers:

- A practical “pipeline” to work comfortably (VS Code).
- What you do (and don’t) need to install to work with Lua for DCS.
- What the common community libraries are (MIST/MOOSE and others) and when they help.
