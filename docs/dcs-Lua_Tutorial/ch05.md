# Chapter 05 — Variables (no fear): store small mission data

## What you’ll learn

- What a variable is (in 30 seconds).
- Why you’ll see `local` everywhere in Lua.
- Basic types: number, text, true/false.
- How this helps in DCS: messages, simple configuration, counters.

## How it is used in DCS

In a mission, variables let you:

- Store “state” (attempts, points, phases).
- Store small configuration (message durations).
- Avoid repeating the same numbers everywhere.

In Lua you’ll commonly write:

- `local name = "Pilot"` (text)
- `local attempts = 1` (number)
- `local training = true` (boolean)

`local` means: “keep this variable here, don’t pollute the whole mission”.

## Quick test (step-by-step)

Goal: show a message built from variables.

1) In your practice mission, add a `MISSION START` trigger.
2) Action: `DO SCRIPT FILE`.
3) Select: [examples/ex05_variables.lua](examples/ex05_variables.lua)
4) Run the mission.

What you should see:

- A message like “Hello, Pilot. Attempts: 1”
- A log line in `dcs.log` containing `attempts=...`

## Common errors and fixes

- **I see `nil` or weird output**:
  - Text needs quotes: `"Pilot"`.
  - Lua concatenates with `..` (not `+`).
- **No log line**:
  - Find `dcs.log` and search for `DCS-Lua-Tutorial`.

> **If you get an error, do this:**
> - Reduce to:
>   - `local x = 1`
>   - `trigger.action.outText("x=" .. x, 10)`
> - When that works, add more lines.

## Mini‑lab (10–20 min): your “attempt counter”

Goal: create a small counter you change by hand (for now).

1) Copy `ex05_variables.lua` into a new file (for example `my_ex05.lua`).
2) Change `attempts = 1` to `attempts = 3`.
3) Change the name to your own.
4) Run again.

Optional: change `fuelPercent` and see the log output change.

## Checklist (what you must see in-game)

- On-screen message includes your name.
- On-screen message includes the attempts number you chose.
- `dcs.log` contains a line with `attempts=`.
