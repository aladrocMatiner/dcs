# Chapter 12 — Events: count what happens (simple counter / scoreboard)

## What you’ll learn

- What an “event” is in DCS (something that happens).
- How to listen with `world.addEventHandler`.
- How to build a simple counter (example: kills).

## How it is used in DCS

Events let missions react to reality:

- Count takeoffs / landings / hits / kills.
- Change phases when something truly happens.
- Build a basic scoreboard.

We stay beginner-level. No frameworks here.

## Quick test (step-by-step)

1) Load at mission start:
   - `MISSION START` → `DO SCRIPT FILE` → [examples/ex12_events_score.lua](examples/ex12_events_score.lua)
2) Run the mission.
3) If a kill happens in the mission, the counter increases.

If your mission has no combat, that’s fine. The mini‑lab uses a more testable event.

## Common errors and fixes

- **Counter never increases**:
  - The event `S_EVENT_KILL` might not be happening.
  - Try a mission with an easy static target and destroy it.
- **Too many messages**:
  - Reduce message duration or throttle events later.

> **If you get an error, do this:**
> - Keep the handler, but replace logic with one fixed message to prove it triggers.

## Mini‑lab (20–30 min): takeoff counter (easier than kills)

Goal: count takeoffs.

1) Copy `ex12_events_score.lua` to `my_ex12_takeoff.lua`.
2) Replace the event check with `world.event.S_EVENT_TAKEOFF`.
3) Show “Takeoffs: X”.
4) Run the mission and take off once.

## Checklist (what you must see in-game)

- When you take off, you see “Takeoffs: 1” (or “Kills: 1” if you tested kills).
- `dcs.log` contains the counter line.
