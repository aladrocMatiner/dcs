# Chapter 15 — Copy/paste recipe library: the things you’ll use most

Chapter example: [examples/ex15_recipes.lua](examples/ex15_recipes.lua)

## What you’ll learn

- A small set of reliable “recipes” you can copy/paste.
- How to combine message + log + scheduler safely.
- How to build mission scripts with fewer mistakes.

## How it is used in DCS

The idea of recipes:

- You keep small, reliable building blocks.
- You reuse them across missions.

This chapter includes recipes for:

- `say(text)` (message)
- `log(text)` (log)
- `getFlag(n)` (read flag)
- `scheduleEvery(n, fn)` (safe repeating)

## Quick test (step-by-step)

1) Load at mission start: [examples/ex15_recipes.lua](examples/ex15_recipes.lua)
2) Run the mission.
3) You should see:
   - An on-screen “recipes loaded” message.
   - A log “tick 10s” every 10 seconds.

## Common errors and fixes

- **The tick does not repeat**:
  - Ensure `scheduleEvery` returns the next time.
- **Performance worries**:
  - Start with reasonable intervals (10–30s).

> **If you get an error, do this:**
> - Remove the scheduler part and keep only `say(...)` + `log(...)`.
> - Once that works, add scheduling back.

## Mini‑lab (20–30 min): your base mission “kit”

Goal: create `my_mission_kit.lua` with your own recipes.

1) Copy `ex15_recipes.lua` into `my_mission_kit.lua`.
2) Change:
   - interval from 10s to 30s
   - initial message text
3) Add one more recipe:
   - `isTrainingOn()` returning `getFlag(10) == 1`
4) In the tick, if training is ON, write an extra log line.

## Checklist (what you must see in-game)

- “kit loaded” on-screen message.
- Periodic tick lines in `dcs.log`.
- No freezing and no message spam.
