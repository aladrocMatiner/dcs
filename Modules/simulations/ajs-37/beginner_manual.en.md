# AJS-37 Viggen (DCS) — Beginner Manual (Pedagogical)

This is a practical, step-by-step guide for someone who is new to flight sims and new to the Viggen.
It is designed to get you from “cold airplane” to “basic mission” without drowning you in theory.

## 0) What You’re Trying To Do

You will learn, in order:

1. Recognize the cockpit areas and the instruments you must watch.
2. Start the aircraft, taxi, and take off safely.
3. Navigate a simple route (basic `NAV` mode).
4. Land safely.

If you only want to get airborne quickly, use [quick_takeoff.en.md](quick_takeoff.en.md).

## 1) A Map of the Cockpit (Don’t Memorize Everything)

First, learn *where* things live:

![Cockpit layout](docs/pedagogical_assets/cockpit_layout.png)

- **Front panel**: main flight instruments + HUD + warning lights.
- **Left side**: many aircraft/system controls (engine, electrical, etc.).
- **Right side**: additional systems and indicators.

### The 6 Things You Always Monitor

1. **Airspeed** (km/h): are you fast enough to take off / climb / land?
2. **Altitude** (m): are you climbing/descending as expected?
3. **Attitude** (pitch/roll): are you level? are you over-rotating?
4. **Engine**: RPM / EGT / EPR (do you have thrust, are temperatures normal?)
5. **Warnings**: master caution, warning lights.
6. **HUD** (if used): takeoff symbology and flight path vector.

## 2) Before You Start (Game Setup)

- Bind controls: pitch/roll/yaw, wheel brakes, throttle, landing gear, flaps (if mapped), and trim.
- If you have rudder pedals: great. If not, ensure your twist axis is smooth.
- Ensure you can see and operate:
  - `Master Mode` selector (you’ll use `NAV` to fly around).
  - `SPAK` (autopilot stabilization) — optional but helpful.

## 3) Taxi (First-Time Friendly)

Taxi is where many beginners crash. Go slow.

- The engine produces a lot of thrust at idle; use small throttle inputs.
- Steering: use pedals; tighter turns require differential braking.
- If you use thrust reverser while taxiing: ensure the area behind is clear.

Goal: reach the runway without overheating, overspeeding, or striking objects.

## 4) Takeoff (Beginner Method)

Use the HUD method from the official procedure.

Before you roll:

- Align with runway.
- Set `Master Mode` to `NAV` **at least 2 minutes** before takeoff power.
- Set landing light `LANDNING` ON.

Procedure (simplified):

1. Hold wheel brakes.
2. Advance throttle to max power **without afterburner**.
3. Release brakes, keep centerline with pedals.
4. If runway is short/heavy: ignite afterburner.
5. Rotate at the correct cues (HUD markers / time-distance line).
6. When airborne: gear up.

Reference: see [quick_takeoff.en.md](quick_takeoff.en.md) for the full checklist and the manual figures.

## 5) Your First Navigation (Keep It Simple)

The Viggen is built for *planned* navigation. As a beginner:

- Use `Master Mode` = `NAV`.
- Fly runway heading, climb safely, then turn toward a clear landmark.
- Avoid “button hunting” right after takeoff: fly the aircraft first.

What “good” looks like:

- Stable climb.
- Stable speed.
- No warning lights.
- Smooth turns.

## 6) Landing (Beginner Pattern)

Keep a wide, gentle pattern. Don’t dive at the runway.

High-level goals:

- Arrive aligned and stable.
- Extend gear early enough to avoid rushing.
- Maintain safe AoA/speed.

If you’re new: practice touch-and-goes in calm weather first.

## 7) Common Beginner Mistakes (And Fixes)

- **Over-rotating on takeoff** → Rotate smoothly; use attitude references, not panic.
- **Chasing the HUD** → Fly the attitude + speed; let the HUD confirm, not command.
- **Taxi too fast** → Idle thrust is strong; brake early, use small throttle changes.
- **Forgetting `NAV` timing** → Set `Master Mode` to `NAV` at least 2 minutes before takeoff power.

## 8) Next Steps (Choose One)

- Practice: 10 takeoffs + 10 landings (same airfield, no weapons).
- Add one new skill: basic route navigation (waypoints) or simple weapon employment.
